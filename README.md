# Detecting-Stress-Based-On-Social-Interaction-On-Social-Networks
Stress is essentially humans' response to various types of desires or threats. This response, when 
working properly,can help us to stay focused, energized and intellectually active, but if it is out 
of proportion, it can certainly be harmful leading to depression, anxiety, hypertension and a host 
of threatening disorders. Cyberspace is a huge soap box for people to post anything and 
everything that they experience in their day-to-day lives. Subsequently, it can be used as a very 
effective tool in determining the stress levels of an individual based on the posts and status 
updates shared by him/her. This is a proposal for a website which takes the Twitter username of 
the subject as an input, scans and analyses the subject's profile by performing Sentiment Analysis 
and gives out results. These results suggest the overall stress levels of the subject and give an 
overview of his/her mental and emotional state. The tool used for analysis of the social media 
account is Rapidminer. Rapid miner is an environment for various data mining and machine 
learning procedures with a very effective and simple GUI.
